I am an assistant professor at the Department of Chinese of National Taiwan Normal University, focusing on corpus and experimental explorations of language in general and grammar in particular.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Linguistics of Academia Sinica, Taiwan. I worked on two individual projects: (1) “On the expression of temporal reference with modal information from a morphosyntactic and psycho-/neuro-linguistic perspective: The case of ‘you (to have) + VP’ in Taiwan Mandarin” (2022-2024), and (2) “Paving the way for ‘field psycholinguistics’ of Formosan languages: Case studies in Truku Seediq, Bunun and Tsou” (2024-2025), with a grant from the Academia Sinica postdoctoral scholar program.

Before that, I graduated from the PhD program of the department of English of National Taiwan Normal University (Linguistic track) in June 2022. During my PhD studies, I was also the manager of the Neurolinguistics Lab of National Taiwan Normal University, where I supervized behavioral, ERP and fMRI experiments about a great variety of language-related topics, such as language relativity, classifier processing or conceptual categorization.
