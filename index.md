# Exploration of language in the mind


Welcome to the website of the Language Processing and Usage Lab, hosted at the Department of Chinese of National Taiwan Normal University!
We aim at understanding how language is used and how it is represented in the mind, using a variety of quantitative methods such as corpus explorations, behavioral experiments and neuroimaging technique to support theoretical analyses.
We are particularly interested in diversity as a whole: diversity of languages (see our research on Taiwan Mandarin, Paiwan, Truku Seediq, and Tagalog, among others), diversity of individuals (younger and older populations, individuals with different socioeconomic backgrounds, etc.), and diversity of topics.
