# Exploration of language in the mind

{:.center}
Welcome to the website of the Language Processing and Usage Lab, hosted
at the Department of Chinese of National Taiwan Normal University!

{:.center}
We aim to understand how language is used and how it is represented in
the mind, using a variety of quantitative methods such as corpus
explorations, behavioral experiments and neuroimaging techniques to
support theoretical analyses. We are particularly interested in
diversity as a whole: diversity of languages, diversity of individuals
(younger and older populations, individuals with different socioeconomic
backgrounds, etc.), and diversity of topics.

**Language studied so far:** English, Paiwan, Tagalog, Taiwan Mandarin,
Truku Seediq
